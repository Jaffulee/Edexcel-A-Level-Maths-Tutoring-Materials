<h2>About</h2>

<p>
This repository contains supplementary materials designed to accompany my
<strong>A-level mathematics tutoring</strong>.
The content is based on common questions, misconceptions, and difficulties
raised during tutoring sessions.
</p>

<p>
The primary aim is to help students develop
<strong>clear, structured mathematical thinking</strong>,
with worked solutions that emphasise
<strong>method selection and reasoning</strong>,
not just carrying out calculations.
</p>

<h2>How to Use These Materials</h2>

<p>
The main resource in this repository is the PDF:
</p>

<p>
<strong><code>Supplementary Materials.pdf</code></strong>
</p>

<p>
This PDF is intended to be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Downloaded and used locally</li>
  <li>Read alongside tutoring sessions or independent study</li>
  <li>Navigated via the clickable table of contents</li>
</ul>

<p>
Students are strongly encouraged to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attempt examples and exercises independently</li>
  <li>Use the worked solutions to check reasoning and approach</li>
  <li>Focus on understanding <em>why</em> a method is chosen, not just how it is executed</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>
The PDF is organised into sections aligned with A-level topics, with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Worked examples</li>
  <li>Explanatory notes highlighting common pitfalls</li>
  <li>Clear step-by-step reasoning</li>
</ul>

<p>
The table of contents within the document links directly to sections for ease of use.
